NightOS is a desktop environment which is based on a custom Linux distribution. It uses the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) technology to access the filesystem, manage the network connections, and manage applications safely.

## How does it work?

NightOS works as a very large JavaScript application, that runs on a Linux + Electron base. This project aims to demonstrate the power of JavaScript by making a full O.S. with this language, so the most tasks that can be handled by it will be done using JS. The Linux system works as an interface, a layer that allows JavaScript to manage the network connections, access the hard drive, and some other low-level things.
